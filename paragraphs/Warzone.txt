My first Warzone win was full of highs and lows that I haven’t felt in other battle royale games, where dying can feel like hitting an invisible wall in the middle of a full sprint. After winning a few early fights in the TV Station, we all died to an enemy ambush and got sent to the Gulag. Amazingly, we all won our 1-on-1 fights and dropped right back into action. From there, we stuck to the shadows and slowly raised funds to call in our favorite custom loadouts. With my tried-and-true M4A1 kitted with a full suite of attachments, I ended with nine kills for a squad total of 20. For as much as Call of Duty: Warzone borrows from the best of its competition, it’s full of smart conveniences that are quickly making it my circle-shrinking murderfest of choice.
