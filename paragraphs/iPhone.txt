The iPhone is a series of smartphones made by Apple Inc since 2007. It does many things that a computer can do, but is small enough to fit in someone's hand. It is a mobile phone, meaning that it makes calls and sends text messages but without wires. There are many types of iPhones, such as the model iPhone X. The iPhone can access the Internet as well, either using a cellular network or over Wi-Fi. Like an iPod, it plays music and videos that have been downloaded from the Internet directly, or which have been put on it by connecting it to a personal computer, which is called syncing. It also has a calendar and 1 or 2 built-in cameras. A user can make it do many other things, such as run video games, by downloading apps from the App Store. The iPhone does not have as many buttons as other well-known phones in the early days, such as those made by companies like Motorola and Nokia. Instead, it had a touch screen that covers much of the front of the phone. People control the phone by touching things that appear on the screen with a finger or two. This technology is called multi-touch, and involves tapping, dragging, and even typing on a keyboard picture shown on the screen.
