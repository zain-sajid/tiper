YouTube is a free video sharing website on the internet. The website lets people upload, view, and share videos. YouTube started on February 14, 2005 by three former workers of PayPal. Now, Google (a search engine company) owns and operates YouTube. YouTube now carries paid advertisements on all pages. Videos can be rated with likes or dislikes, and viewers can subscribe to channels they like. Videos can be commented on if viewers log into their own accounts. The number of times a video has been watched (known as "views") is shown. Many different types of videos can be put onto the website, such as educational content, animations, and events.
